The code was developed using <b>Python version 3.6.11.</b> Libraries used, include: <br>
1. pip - to install and manage packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
2. numpy - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for array data handling
3. pandas - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for database and dataframe handling
4. sklearn - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  machine learning and analysis module, specifically train-test split and Linear Regression
5. matplotlib - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) visualization and plotting library
6. seaborn- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) visualization library based on matplotlib
7. yfinance - Stock prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the stocks data from Yahoo Finance to answer the following:

1. What kind of gains do we expect from the various listings?
2. How do the price gains of the different listings correlate to each other?
3. What is the estimated listing price/stock at a future date (prediction)?
4. What kind of volatility do the listings have?
5. How can we use our analysis to form a balanced investment portfolio?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The files required as part of this assignment include: <br>
1. Stocks_Analysis_vX.X.ipynb - The main code </br>
Recommendation: Apply 24w historical to atleast 6 weeks forward

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the analysis can be found at the post available here: [An Investing Newbie's Tryst with Data Science](https://medium.com/@kgraghav/an-investing-newbies-tryst-with-data-science-241737102a6a).
