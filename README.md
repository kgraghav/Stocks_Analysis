## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the stocks data from Yahoo Finance to answer the following:

1. What kind of gains do we expect from the various listings?
2. How do the price gains of the different listings correlate to each other?
3. What is the estimated listing price/stock at a future date (prediction)?
4. What kind of volatility do the listings have?
5. How can we use our analysis to form a balanced investment portfolio?
